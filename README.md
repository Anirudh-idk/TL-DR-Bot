# Chronoscript - Task 1

As a part of my cruX Round 3 Tasks I was to make changes to chronoscript adding several features and build on it.
Here onwards I have only mentioned information specific to the task for detailed information about chronoscript please visit [this](https://github.com/crux-bphc/chronoscript/blob/master/README.md).
My fork for this task is linked [here](https://github.com/Anirudh-idk/chronoscript).

## Added Functionalities
1. Add an interactive cli script to allow user to set parameters and give inputs through terminal and minimize edits to src files.

2. Add a feature for user to pass section(s) they don't want, for e.g. MATH F111 L1, and subsequently don't include them in the generated timetables.

3. Include an option to ask for user's preferred exam schedule fit(spread out exams,avoid two exams on a day,etc.),sort and output generated timetables based on the requested fit.

## usage
1. clone the fork on your local machine.

2. run `main.py` inside the `src` directory.

## Contributing
Since this is just a task and heavily related to the original script contributing here follows the same instructions as the original script which can be found [here](https://github.com/crux-bphc/chronoscript/blob/master/README.md#contributing).
